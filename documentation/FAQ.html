<h1>Why is the Internet Explorer started?</h1>
<p>When the Earthdawn character editor start an helper application to render the XML as HTML, the editor ask the Java virtual machine to launch the operation systems linked default application. If you have set e.g. Firefox as default browser. The operation system has linked Firefox to html files. But normally the Internet Explorer is still linked to XML files. By this you need to link the application Firefox to XML files, if you want that the Earthdawn character editor to launch Firefox for rendering a XML file as HTML.</p>

<h1>Legend Point Mismatch</h1>
<p>The Earthdawn Character Editor knows to kind of legend points (1) the calculated legend points and (2) the given legend points. And they have both two different jobs:</p>
<ol>
<li>The calculated legend points are full automated generated by counting talents, spells, attributes, etc. every time the character goes through the internal parser. It tries to best fit the legend point calculation defined by the rules. But they can be complex, think about multi-disciplines and realigned talents and skills. So there is always a chance for errors and bugs. That is why there is still a second (backup) legend point calculation: the given legend points.</li>
<li>The normal or given legend points are fully under the control of the player. There is an own tab (named “experience”) for entering the earnings and expenses of legend points. Here the legend points are managed in (finance) accounting style. The player can use this for controlling the calculated legend points. And this legend points are the only legend points which will be exported to the character sheets. At the end the field “current legend points” should be identical to the field “calculated not used legend points”. If the two fields are not showing the same value, then one is doing wrong. Either the Earthdawn Character Editor (please send a bug report) or the player has miscounted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Until now there is only one direct connection between (1) the calculated legend points and (2) the given legend points:</p>
<blockquote>When the internal parser sees that he now calculate a higher amount of legend point then the last time, he insert an assumption into the given legend point accounting. This assumption is marked that it was insert by the Earthdawn Character Editor and have to be validated by the player. The player can delete it, rename it, change the amount, etc.</blockquote>
<p>The inverse way is not supported. If the internal parser sees that he now calculate a lower amount of legend point, then he will do nothing. He can not determine which accounting entry have to be modified. It is not his territory. He will not modify the players accounting entries. So the player knows he can always trust his given legend point accounting, even if the Earthdawn Character Editor calculates wrong legend points.</p>

<h1>Will not enforce rules</h1>
<p>It is important to notice, that the Earthdawn Character Editor is not to designed to enforce rules. It is intend to be a tool for easily create, edit and manage Earthdawn characters conform to the rules.</p>
<p>For example you can spend more than the allowed attribute buy points or earned legend points, which result in negative attribute buy points or negative legend points. Just in case of a normal character sheet, the player is responsible that his character is conform to the rules. The Earthdawn Character Editor supports him to do so, e.g. by showing him that the buy points or legend points are negative.</p>
<p>Another example is, that you can edit the xml-file and add more talents by hand. This talents will not be deleted. Such a behaviour intends to give the player more flexibility how to use the Earthdawn Character Editor. Even if he/she like to have a non conform character.</p>

<h1>The shown movement rate differs from the race movement rate</h1>
<p>It is possible to chose different movement rate definitions. The default movement rate definitions is the optional rule for strength based movement. This is configured by the parameter “ATTRIBUTEBASEDMOVEMENT” within the optional optionalrules.xml file. Right now the following modifier are implemented: "STR", "DEX" or "na". The last one means that the namegiver fixed movement rate will be set.</p>

<h1>How do I merge multiple capabilities XML files</h1>
<p>The Earthdawn Character Editor contains the tool "JoinCapabilities" to merge multi capabilities XML files. It can be used by executing the flowing command:</p>
<pre>java -cp EarthdawnCharacterEditor.jar de.earthdawn.tool.JoinCapabilities NewCapabilities1.xml NewCapabilities2.xml NewCapabilities3.xml MergedCapabilities.xml</pre>
