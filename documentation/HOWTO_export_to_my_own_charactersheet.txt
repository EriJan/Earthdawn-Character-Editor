HOW-TO export to my own character sheet 
=======================================

If included deployed character sheet do not suffice your needs. You may want to choose your own character sheet to be filled out by the character editor.

This is possible but you have to comply with the following requirements:

1) The character sheet is available as PDF document.
2) The PDF character sheet supports PDF form fields.
3) The PDF form fields are named analogue to one of the existing PDF character sheets.

You can take a look at the files *.data_fields.txt within this documentation folder to see which field names exists in each PDF character sheet.

If you are able to fulfil the requirements above. You can just replace one of the existing PDF character sheets with yours. But I would also be pleased, if you send your character sheet to me, so I can include it into the character editor as additional choice. So your character sheet will also be available to other Earthdawn people.

If you are not totally able to fulfil requirement 3 it may still be possible to support your character sheet. Just send it to me. Give me some comments with which field you have trouble. If possible, I may extend the character editors PDF export to support your fields.


If your are planning to create a new PDF character sheet supporting your character own/group needs, I would be really happy if you decide to use libreoffice/openoffice or scribus for your project.

Here is a old but still useful HowTo for creating PDF forms with openoffice:
